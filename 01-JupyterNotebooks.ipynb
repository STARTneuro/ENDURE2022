    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are a way to combine executable code, code outputs, and text into one connected file. They run in a web browser, but don't require the internet (unless you're running it on Colab, in which case we're using Google servers to run the code).\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>'kernel'</b> is the thing that executes your code. It is what connects the notebook (as you see it) with the part of your computer, or the Google servers, that runs code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks have two types of cells, a <b>Markdown</b> (like this one) and <b>Code</b>. In the notebooks for this workshop, you don't need to run the Markdown cells, just read through them. However, when we get to a code cell, you need to tell Python to run the lines of code that it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many useful keyboard shortcuts in these notebooks, which you'll learn to use in time. Click on the 'Tools' menu, and then 'Keyboard Shortcuts' to see a list.\n",

    "### Using Markdown\n",
    "Markdown is useful because it can be formatted using simple symbols.\n",
    "* You can create bulleted lists using asterisks.\n",
    "* Similarly, you can create numbered lists using numbers.\n",
    "* You can **bold** with two asterisks or underscores on either side (`**bold**`) or *italicize* with one asterisk or underscore (`*italicize*`)\n",
    "* Pound signs (#) create headers. More pound signs means a smaller header.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task**: Edit the markdown cell below by double clicking it. Fill it with a quick biography of yourself. You should have your name as a big header, a short quippy subtitle for yourself as a smaller header, and a three bullet points that use both **bold** and *italic*.</div>"
